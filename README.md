## Background

A common problem when working with automated or semi-automated reports
is the need to manage references alongside input parameters and other
data. For example if I have a model that has costs from Williams et al.
(2020) and I want to change the cost of that intervention to be from
Jameson et al. (2024) then I would want the value to be updated in the
model, but also the reference to be updated in the report.

| Label             | Value | Reference              |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------|
| Cost of something | \$100 | Williams et al. (2020) |

This package is designed to help with that problem, by allowing users to
provide references in a data frame (likely read in from Excel). This
means that users who are not R programmers can easily update parameter
values and references in the input tables and re-run the R code (either
automated or semi-automated) to update the report with the new values
and references.

## Overview

The `bibby` package provides functions to work with bibtex entries in R.
The benefit is automated updates of references in R Markdown documents
(.Rmd) if new references are added or existing ones are updated. The
downside is that it requires users to enter the references as BiBTeX
entries in the input tables, which may not be familiar to all users.

| Label             | Value | Reference                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Cost of something | \$100 | '@article{williams2020costofsomething, title={Cost of something in something else}, author={Williams, John and Smith, Jane},journal={New England Journal of Medicine},volume={377},number={10},pages={936--946},year={2020},publisher={Mass Medical Soc}}' |

It does two things: 

1) The BiBTeX entries provided in tables are
replaced with tags suitable for .Rmd. 

2) The bibtex entries are written
to a .bib file which is used by the .Rmd document to generate the
bibliography.

There is no need to manually edit the .bib file, as the package will
automatically update the .bib file with the new entries. This means that
users can easily update the references in their input tables and re-run
the R code to update the report with the new values and references.

This process can be embedded into automated workflows, shiny or with
databases such as DuckDB or SQLite. The package is designed to be simple
to use and flexible, allowing users to easily manage their references in
R.

## Installation

The development version of assertHE can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dark-peak-analytics/bibby")

library(bibby)
```

## Use

Hopefully simple to use. Just specify the bibtex entry and the output
type required.

For example the code below should return the bibtex tag for the entry
("@smith2020making").

``` r

extract_bibtex_tag(
  bibtex_entry =  "@article{smith2020making,
                            title={Making health economic models Shiny: A tutorial},
                            author={Smith, Robert and Schneider, Paul},
                            journal={Wellcome open research},
                            volume={5},
                            pages={69},
                            year={2020}}",
  output = "markdown_long")

# Returns:
# "@smith2020making"
```

If you have a list of bibtex entries, you can then use the
`update_bib_file_from_vector` function to update a .bib file with the
new entries. For example the code below will update the file
`bibby_refs.bib` with the new entries (creating it if the file doesn't
exist). The `verbose` argument will print the new entries to the
console. The function also returns the bibtex tags of all entries for
use in other functions.

``` r

update_bib_file_from_vector(path = "bibby_refs.bib",
                            v_bibtex_entries = bibby::v_example_refs,
                            verbose = TRUE, 
                            output_type = "markdown_short"
                            )
                            
# Returns:
# [1] "[@smith2020making]"   "[@tordrup2022global]" "[@xie2015]"           "[@baio2017bceaweb]"   "[@gmailr]"           
# [6] "[@baio2017bceaweb2]"  "[@hart2020r]"         "(Assumption)"  
# And fills the file `bibby_refs.bib` with the original BiBTeX.

                            
```

This is a beta version of the package, so please report any issues or
suggestions. We are using this on several client projects and it is
working well, but we are always looking for ways to improve the package
and make it more useful for users.
